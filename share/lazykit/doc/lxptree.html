    <h1>lxptree: construct XML trees</h1>

    <p>
      Construct an XmlTree from a string or file.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The implementation depends on LuaExpat, an expat binding.
    </p>

    <h2>lxptree.parsestring(s)</h2>
    
    <p>
      Return an XML tree parsed from the string <code>s</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>lxptree.parsefile(file)</h2>
    
    <p>
          Returns a tree lazily parsed from <code>file</code>.  If
          <code>file</code> is a string, it is interpreted as a
          filename and opened; otherwise, <code>file</code> is treated
          as an io library file object.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Note that <code>file</code> is read and parsed as one big chunk,
      so running this on a 2G file may be a bad idea.  On the other
      hand, building a tree of a 2G file would be a worse idea.
