    <h1>xmltree: a mid-level structure for XML</h1>
    
    <p>
      This document describes a mid-level representation of XML as
      trees in Lua.  It is intended to be saved into the lua-users
      wiki as a place to remember discussion on this subject.
    </p>

    <p>
      The representation is intended to describe data from the XML
      Infoset, yet remain simple to work with in idiomatic Lua code.
      The representation is an interface, allowing fancy
      implementations to use metatables to provide the same interface
      as bare tables.
    </p>

    <p>
      LxpTree and LazyTree implement this.
    </p>

    <h2>Spec by example</h2>

    <pre>&lt;paragraph justify='centered'&gt;first child&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;second child&lt;/paragraph&gt;</pre>

    <pre>lz = {name="paragraph", attr={justify="centered"}, 
  "first child",
  {name="b", "bold", n=1}
  "second child",
  n=3
}</pre>

    <h2>Strawman spec</h2>

    <p>
      A <dfn>tree</dfn> is a Lua table representation of an element
      and its contents. The table must have a <code>name</code> key,
      giving the element name.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tree may have a <code>attr</code> key, which gives a table
      of all of the attributes of the element.  Only string keys are
      relevant.  (LuaExpat uses numeric keys to mark attributes that
      were defaulted from the DTD.)  A convenience iterator like
      <code>xattrpairs(tree)</code> should be provided.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the element is not empty, each child node is contained in
      <code>tree[1]</code>, <code>tree[2]</code>, etc.  Child nodes
      may be either strings, denoting character data content, or other
      trees.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Parsers should try to merge adjacent character data content.  That is, they should avoid producing something like:
    </p>
    
    <pre
>{name="p", "Hello w", "orld"}</pre>

    <p>
      Parsers should include an <code>n</code> key, giving the number
      of child nodes.  However, to be tolerant of tree literals in
      code, general-purpose processing code should use code like
    </p>

    <pre
>tree.n or table.getn(tree)</pre>

    <p>
      (found as <code>xmliter.getn(tree)</code>), in the same way they
      would use <code>table.getn(list)</code> on normal lists instead
      of <code>list.n</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      (Why a separate <code>getn</code>? This is necessary because
      <code>table.getn(tree)</code> does not explicitly call for
      <code>tree.n</code>, instead using <code>rawget(tree,
      "n")</code>.  Fancy tree implementations may need to use a
      metatable call to find the number of children.)
    </p>

    <h2>Things explicitly not modeled</h2>

    <p>
      Syntactic details of XML source files are out of scope.  To wit:
    </p>

    <p>
      The order of attributes on elements is unimportant.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The presence of a CDATA section is not interesting; it is just
      another way to write character data.
    </p>

    <p>
      Comments are not interesting.
    </p>

    <p>
      The source of attributes, whether explicit or specified in a DTD
      is not interesting.
    </p>
      
    <h2>Things explicitly modeled</h2>

    <p>
      All elements, regardless of duplicates.
    </p>
    <p>
      All character data.  That includes mixed content.
    </p>
    <p>
      The order of the above.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Things that should be modeled</h2>
    
    <p>
      DTD.  This could go in <code>root.dtd</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Encoding.  However, declaring everything to be in UTF-8 might
      not be so bad---especially for USASCII users....
    </p>

    <p>
      Namespaces.  I don't have enough experience with them to propose
      a design.
