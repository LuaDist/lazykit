    <h1>xmlview: convenient access to XML trees</h1>
    
    <p>
      This package is a work in progress for XmlTree.  Quick summary:
    </p>

    <h3>xstring(node)</h3>

    <p>
      Returns the immediate string contents of node (which may be
      either a tree or, trivially, a string.)  Returns
      <code>nil,errormessage</code> if <code>node</code> is a tree
      with mixed content.
    </p>

    <h3>xtext(node)</h3>

    <p>
      Recursively returns the string contents of <code>node</code>,
      descending into any child elements.
    </p>

    <h2>View objects</h2>

    <p>
      Views provide easy random access to the children of a XmlTree.
      They are currently read-only.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      The current implementation completely populates them on first
      access, but lazy implementations are possible.
    </p>

    <h3>xmlview.string(tree)</h3>

    <p>
      Create a string view on <code>tree</code>.  The view contains
      all immediate children of <code>tree</code> that have unique
      element names and do not contain mixed content.  Accessing names
      that are not unique or have mixed content results in an error.
      Example:
    </p>

    <pre
>&lt;logentry&gt;
  &lt;type&gt;INFO&lt;/info&gt;
  &lt;time&gt;12:50&lt;/time&gt;
  &lt;receivedfrom&gt;upstream1&lt;/receivedfrom&gt;
  &lt;receivedfrom&gt;upstream2&lt;/receivedfrom&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;This is a &lt;b&gt;test message&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;empty/&gt;
&lt;/logentry&gt;

tree=lxptree.parsestring(s)
sv = xmlview.string(tree)
print(sv.type)          -- "INFO"
print(sv.time)          -- "12:50"
print(sv.empty)         -- ""
print(sv.receivedfrom)  -- error "contains duplicate content"
print(sv.body)          -- error "contains mixed content"</pre>

    <h3>xmlview.text(tree)</h3>
    
    <p>
      Create a text view on <code>tree</code>.  The view contains all
      immediate children of <code>tree</code> that have unique element
      names.  <code>xtext</code> is called on those children,
      providing the recursive character data content of those nodes.
      Accessing names that are not unique results in an error.
    </p>

    <h3>xmlview.elements(tree)</h3>

    <p>
      Create an elements view on <code>tree</code>.  The view contains
      a list of all child element trees with the given name.  Example:
    </p>

    <pre
>ev = xmlview.elements(tree)
ev.type => {{name="type", "INFO", n=1}, n=1}
ev.receivedfrom => {
  {name="receivedfrom", "upstream1", n=1}, 
  {name="receivedfrom", "upstream2", n=1},
  n=2
}</pre>

    <h2>What's missing</h2>

    <p>
      <code>element</code> would provide named elements if they were
      unique.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>firststring</code>, <code>firsttext</code>, and
      <code>firstelement</code> would be views that did not have to
      iterate through the entire tree, as they would not have to
      guarantee uniqueness.  This could be friendlier to lazy trees.
    </p>
