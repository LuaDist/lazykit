    <h1>lazytree: lazily construct XML trees</h1>

    <p>
      LazyTree constructs an conventional-seeming XmlTree as its
      contents are referenced, parsing more source document as
      necessary to fill out the contents on demand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why is this interesting?  Trees are a natural data model to
      process XML documents.  A simple tree implementation reads the
      entire document into memory at once.  For large documents, this
      can be too expensive.  Although callback and event APIs are
      memory-efficient, they are painful to program to.
    </p>
    
    <p>Given stylized iterators, memory consumption can be limited to
    particular subtrees.  Consider:</p>

<pre
>for i,child in xnpairs_c(tree) do
  if child.attr.href then 
    print(child.name)
    table.insert(references, child)
  end
end</pre>

    <p>
      where the <code>_c</code> family of iterators nils out nodes
      from their parent before returning them.  If the body of the
      loop does not retain a reference to the child elsewhere, it will
      become eligible for garbage collection as soon as the next
      iteration begins.  See ConsumingXml.
    </p>

    <p>Although not currently implemented, other consuming forms may
    interact with the XML parser for greater savings:</p>

<pre>
&lt;document&gt;
  &lt;firstname&gt;Jay&lt;/firstname&gt;
  &lt;lastname&gt;Carlson&lt;/lastname&gt;
  &lt;bodytext&gt;Spending too much time listening to &lt;ref&gt;In Utero&lt;/ref&gt; can be [...]
  &lt;title&gt;I Think I'm DOM&lt;/title&gt;</pre>

    <pre>lastname, title = xmlextract.strings_consume(tree, "lastname", "title")</pre>

    <p>The <code>strings_consume</code> filter can potentially turn
    off character data and other events inside any node it knows it
    doesn't need (like <code>bodytext</code>), as references to them
    cannot possibly affect the rest of the program.</p>

    <h2>Dependencies</h2>

    <p>
      <code>lazytree</code> depends on <code>lxpevent</code> to
      generate event queues, which depends on LuaExpat.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Cautions</h2>

    <p>
      Calling the normal <code>ipairs</code> iterator on a lazytree
      that has not been completely loaded will not work, as
      <code>ipairs(lz)</code> does not directly reference
      <code>lz.n</code>.  Use the XmlIter iterators
      <code>xpairs{_c}</code> and <code>xnpairs{_c}</code>; the second
      is more convenient anyway.  See XmlIter.
    </p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    
    <h3>lazytree.parsestring(s)</h3>

    <p>
      Returns a tree lazily parsed from the string <code>s</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>lazytree.parsefile(file)</h3>

    <p>
      Returns a tree lazily parsed from <code>file</code>.  If
      <code>file</code> is a string, it is interpreted as a filename
      and opened; otherwise, <code>file</code> is treated as an io
      library file object.
    </p>

    <h3>lazytree.parseevents(event_source)</h3>
    
    <p>
      Returns a tree lazily parsed from the <code>lxpevent</code>
      <code>event_source</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>lazytree.load(tree)</h3>

    <p>
      Force the entire contents of <code>tree</code> to be read in.
      It is safe to call this on non-lazy trees.
    </p>

    <h3>lazytree.consume(tree)</h3>

    <p>
      Indicate <code>tree</code> is no longer needed and may be
      destroyed.  <code>tree</code> may be either a lazytree or a
      conventional tree, and should be the last reference to it.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Although not currently implemented, calling consume on the part
      of the lazytree currently being built could tell the lazy parser
      not to bother populating that portion of the tree.  This is not
      intended as a general user tool; rather, it is a primitive that
      can be used by consuming filtering iterators such as
      <code>xmliter.switch</code> when they notice that a tree they
      have encountered will be skipped and have no visibility in the
      application.
    </p>

    <h3>lazytree.lazyprint(tree)</h3>

    <p>
      Prints the current contents of a lazytree without further
      parsing.  Useful for demonstration purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Implementation details</h2>

    <p>Given the following XML:</p>
    
    <pre>&lt;paragraph justify='centered'&gt;first child&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;second child&lt;/paragraph&gt;</pre>

    <p>A lazytree will appear to have the following contents:</p>

    <pre>lz = {name="paragraph", attr={justify="centered"}, 
  "first child", 
  {name="b", "bold", n=1},
  "second child",
  n=3
}</pre>

    <p>However, on the start of parsing, the actual underlying table will contain:</p>

<pre>lz = {name="paragraph", attr={justify="centered"}, 
  _read_so_far=0
}</pre>

    <p>After a reference to <code>lz[1]</code>, it will contain:</p>

<pre>lz = {name="paragraph", attr={justify="centered"}, 
  "first child",
  _read_so_far=1
}</pre>

    <p>And after a reference to <code>lz[2]</code>:</p>

    <pre>lz = {name="paragraph", attr={justify="centered"}, 
  "first child",
  {name="b", _read_so_far=0}
}</pre>

    <p>Note that the child is read lazily as well.  However, a
    reference to <code>lz[3]</code> will force all of
    <code>lz[2]</code> to be completed:</p>

    <pre>lz = {name="paragraph", attr={justify="centered"}, 
  "first child",
  {name="b", "bold", n=1}
  "second child",
  _read_so_far=3
}</pre>

    <p>Reading either <code>lz[4]</code> (which is nil) or
    <code>lz.n</code> will force the completion of the tree.</p>

    <p>
      Note that reading from <code>lz.n</code> will force the
      remainder of the tree to be read, as we don't know how long it's
      going to be until it closes.
    </p>
